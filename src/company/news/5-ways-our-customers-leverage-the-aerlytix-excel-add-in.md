With 750 million users worldwide, Excel is the go-to for any financial analysis. The aviation finance industry is no exception in relying on the spreadsheet software for investment analysis. 

However, as customer fleets grow, reliance on Excel alone for asset management leads to inefficient processes and any envisaged economies of scale are lost.

### Drawbacks of Excel for aviation asset management
<br />

**Change Management / Version Control** – once a spreadsheet is shared, tracking changes across an organization is unworkable, especially as users grow. Identification of the “latest or correct” version causes delay in time-to-market. 

**Key-person risk** – for good reasons, asset forecasting and valuation models undergo many version updates as requirements evolve – each iteration making the Excel model more esoteric. Consequently, there is one or at best a handful of personnel depended upon to competently run/validate the Excel model.  Over time, this situation culminates in legacy, handover and model IP issues as individuals inevitably move on. there is often one person responsible for running legacy pricing spreadsheet models: “the model guy”. But when that person is away or leaves the company, getting the next person up to speed can bring workflows to a screeching halt.  

**Security** – while cloud environments are generally secure, it is all too easy to download a spreadsheet file locally, leaving an organization exposed to data and intellectual property loss. Limited data security exists within spreadsheets to protect against the loss of intellectual property (IP). 

**Absence of Integration and Automation** – perhaps its greatest drawback, Excel’s lack of automation and database connectivity leads to onerous periodic processes for portfolio and fleet managers in maintaining technical and lease statuses for forecasting. Such manual processes are prone to greater operational risk from human errors, e.g. copy-paste. Beyond the risk of human error, duplicative data entry for mundane monthly reporting leads to unnecessary headcount growth. 

**Large Data Limitations** – Excel suffers performance issues when dealing with large datasets stored within sheets. Externally linked datasets only increase the potential for data corruption; and therefore, wasted effort. Every analyst has faced the daunting task of opening a 20+ MB file.
