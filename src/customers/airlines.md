      <h4>Client Background</h4>
      <p class="mb-5">Dry leasing is a critical part of airlines' ability to finance both new and mid-life aircraft, while wet-leasing enables operators to fill capacity gaps.</p>
      <h4>Business Challenge and Problem</h4>
      <p>Leasing is a non-primary business function. With limited internal expertise and resources available, business decisions are made in siloed departments leading to cost leakage and significant end-of-lease financial exposures.</p>
      <h4>Differentiated Aerlytix Capabilities</h4>
      <p  class="mb-5">From initial RFP to aircraft re-delivery Aerlytix brings the first multi-layered SaaS analytics solution custom-built for the aviation industry​. With a centralized database repository for all asset and lease data​, leasing implications are incorporated in all fleet decisions. As an API-centric engine, Aerlytix integrates with M&E systems for automation of all forecasts, and the ability to distill outputs across functions.</p>
      <h4>Business Impacts</h4>
      <p>With a track record of successful implementation, Aerlytix drives immediate value to under-resourced fleet teams. With an interconnected infrastructure decision making is simplified with access to all required data, and Aerlytix engine outputs are readily available across functions.</p>
