    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <h4>Client Background</h4>
      <p class="mb-5">A leading asset manager and servicer, identified the need for enhanced reporting in the ABS market following feedback from investors. This marked the beginning of a successful partnership with Aerlytix.</p>
      <h4>Business Challenge and Problem</h4>
      <p class="mb-5">The ABS market faced challenges in valuing holdings, especially after significant lease restructurings due to the impact of Covid-19. Investors sought detailed breakdowns per aircraft, jurisdictional insights, and accurate maintenance status, realizing the limitations of traditional monthly noteholder reports.</p>
      <h4>Differentiated Aerlytix Capabilities</h4>
      <p class="mb-5">Powered by Aerlytix’s technology, the servicer launched an ABS investor portal that enhances aircraft fund reporting. Investors now have a much clearer picture of their investment. The portal has given investors access to detailed information per aircraft, including lease rate ranges, maintenance status, forward projections, and estimated end-of-lease compensation payments.</p>
      <h4>Business Impact</h4>
      <p>The ABS investor portal feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from the major noteholders, offering them unprecedented access to real-time data. With it, the servicer has transformed itself into a digital servicer, allowing clients to access details of their investments at any time. This advanced system can establish itself as the standard reporting mechanism for ABS structures, contributing to deal-making and driving greater transparency in the ABS space.</p>
